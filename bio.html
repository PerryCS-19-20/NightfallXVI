          <h2> My name is Chris King, i'm 15 years old and i am into coding, specifically for gaming consoles.
              I'm an xbox 360 modder, and have a slight experience with computer science. i program launch.ini
              files for people who just switched to a new stealth server or mod menu, and that don't know how to customize their dashlaunch.
              I took software engineering class so i could explore more about the world of computer science. When i grow up i plan to be a video game developer because
              i want a job that i can enjoy and make enough money to support myself at the same time.
